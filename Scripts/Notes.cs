    TODO: Swtich "Go" button to "Say Go"

    Make Count at least 2 sections. Start Second section
    with "pairs count" chunk. Add, 3 of a kind is actually 3 pairs and 4 of a kind 6 Pairs.

    New Section for Runs: Flesh out double runs.

    Flushes, Missing a space and apeirod in the chunk. Change: "A flush must consiste of all 4 cards in your hand and is worth 4 points. If it also includes the 'Cut' card
    it is worth 5 points."

    In the "remember" section aces count as one, mention that face cards count as ten for making 15s.

    PROBLEM: Crib text for when dealer is AI, is same as Count Hands.

    

    Make action buttons a lighter color and make the stage indicator darker.
    FIXED

    When AI gets a go but the playing stage will continue, he sits a little too long before the stage resets.

    If AI plays first card of the new round but that is also the last card of the stage
    The Last Card button comes up but the AI doesn't proceed with "last card".
    FIXED!

    Correct Playing hand vs playing THE hand in Round summayr for both players. Make consistent.
    FIXED

    show score after counting hand and crib, even if zero.
    FIXED

    on round summary, have columns match columns of score (i.e. player on left, opponent on right in both cases), they are currently inverted.
    FIXED

    Can't see full score as player when score is greater than 100
    FIXED

    Play count doesn't zero out after starting new game following old game.
    FIXED

    Can't open menu in top left corner
    FIXED

    Maybe also consider making the text bubbles a lighter grey so that you are more likely to notice them out of the corner of your eye when they pop up?
    FIXED

    on round summary, indicate who's score is in which column.
    FIXED

    On the round summary, be consistent in how you convey the absence of a run, flush, etc...
        Example:
        Runs - 3
        Fifteens - 2
        Pairs - 0
        Flushes - 0
        Right Jack - 0
    FIXED
